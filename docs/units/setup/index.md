# Getting Started

Before stating the units, you will need to:

* [Install Vitis and Vivado](../../support/amd):  These are the main software tools from AMD that we will use to design, synthesize and simulate the hardware and processing systems
* [Clone the class GitHub repository](../../support/repo/):  The repo has all the demos and class material
* Purhcase and [set-up and FPGA board](../../support/hw_setup/):  If you want to deploy your hardware to actual FPGA board, you will have to purchase a board and set it up.  
You can skip this step if you only want to conduct the work in simulation.
